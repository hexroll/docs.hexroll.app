## Sandbox mods

Scrolls that can be used when generating a new realm to modify the existing rules of HEXROLL 2E.

### Ready-to-use

These scrolls are ready-to-use and tested with the current version of the generator:

#### NPC Deities

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/RTq5YUJS](https://scroll.hexroll.app/RTq5YUJS) -
This builds on the Deities generator, making each NPC follow one of the realm's deities.

#### Deities Shrines

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/YSEXW3qX](https://scroll.hexroll.app/YSEXW3qX) -
Builds on the Deities scroll, adding deity shrines as another hex feature.

#### Shops prices factor

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/5NJsBHMG](https://scroll.hexroll.app/5NJsBHMG) -
Change the factor of shop prices. Useful if you play another system with different item price ranges.

#### Alternative NPC names

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/9sLC31em](https://scroll.hexroll.app/9sLC31em) -
An alternative NPC name generator, composing syllables rather than rolling for a name from a table.

### Samples and starting-points

These scrolls are usable, but cover only a small aspect or are partial and require further work to be fully useful:

#### Realm and Region names

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/qHPiTi35](https://scroll.hexroll.app/qHPiTi35) -
Shows how you can enforce specific realm and/or region names.

#### Goblins warband appearing in deserts

[https://scroll.hexroll.app/h3V3FDCv](https://scroll.hexroll.app/h3V3FDCv) -
Shows how you can roll warbands or potentially other groups of monsters as hex encounters.
