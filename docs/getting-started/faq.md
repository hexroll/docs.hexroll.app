# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is this THAC0? Your NPC and monsters stats blocks look weird?

These are OSR-compatible stats. Use the numbers inside the brackets for the more familiar Ascending AC and Attack Modifier.

### What hex size is HEXROLL using.

HEXROLL does not prescribe a specific hex size, but I currently use and recommend 6 miles from center to center.

### Where can I see an overview of my sandbox?

Click the ToC button at the header of any sandbox page to get to the Table-of-Content.

### Nothing happens when I click any hex in the map. I cannot get into crawl-mode.

This is likely a browser extension conflict. Specifically, _Dark Reader_ was found to be causing this issue.

### I'm trying to get into my sandbox, but end up in the "infinite void" (page not found)

If you are a Patreon-subscriber - make sure you are logged-in to your Patreon account on hexroll.app.

### I downloaded the sandbox file but nothing happens when I click it.

Download Hexroll Backpack, open the app and then choose the file from the app to view your sandbox.

## Generator

### How can I add an Island without it being attached to the mainland?

Click a far enough ocean hex and create the new realm using the hex menu.

### Can I have smaller dungeons?

Click the 'prefer smaller dungeons' checkbox when generating a new realm.

### Can I draw my own map and then generate content for it?

Unlike a hex map editor, HEXROLL is primarily a random generator. Try unlocking the map and using some of the post-generation map editing tools to see if you can get to your desired result.

## VTT

### Why can't my players see the dungeon areas I reveal when using the VTT?

Make sure you add at-least one token with a light-source (torch or lantern).

### Is there a way to change the color of a token?

Double-click the token.

### Is there a way to see which dungeon areas have monsters in them?

Yes. Click the labels toggle to get an icon on any dungeon area with a monster inside.

### Can I use any hex as a battlemap?

Yes. Zoom into the hex until you see the grid-map.

### How can I mark locations between sessions?

Use a map pin. Press **`P`** when in crawl-mode to mark the current location. Only one pin is available per hex though.

## Content Editing

### How can I change the content of a hex?

You can often re-roll hex entities by unlocking the page, or you can directly edit the page using the integrated editor.

### How can I rename a town, region or realm?

When editing the page (using the feather symbol), click the entity name in the header, edit it and press ESC.

### Can I change the name of a specific NPC?

Renaming an NPC consistently across the sandbox is currently not supported, but you can rename an NPC locally by editing the page.

### Help! I edited a page but I want to revert back to the original content.

Press the `revert` button in the page editor toolbar.

### Can I change or add to the tables HEXROLL is using?

Yes - using [SCROLL](https://scroll.hexroll.app) mods. Read more about this [here](/scroll/scroll-mods/).
