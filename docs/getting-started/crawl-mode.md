# Crawl Mode

If you zoom in enough to click on an individual hex, your screen layout will change to `crawl mode`.

In crawl mode you'll be able to see the hex content side by side with the map. In this mode you can continue navigating the map by clicking hexes or dragging the map to any side.

!!! tip
You can also use the `WASD+QE` keys to navigate from hex to hex.

Using the mouse wheel in crawl mode will get you back into the full screen map mode.

Your browser's `go back` and `go forward` buttons and keyboard shortcuts are also useful to navigate back and to visited locations. You can also use your browser to bookmark locations to go back to or track important events.

Crawl mode works the same with dungeon maps too.

When in crawl mode, you can unlock the content by clicking the lock symbol in the header. You will then be able to reroll the current entity by clicking the dice symbol in the header:

or reroll other linked entities by clicking any of the dice symbols inside the text:

!!! note
Re-rolling entities might have a cascading effect on other parts of your sandbox. For example, if you re-roll a dungeon, any lost item or captive NPC will likely be relocated to other dungeons.
