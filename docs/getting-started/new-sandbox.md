# Rolling a Sandbox

To create your first sandbox, navigate your browser to [https://hexroll.app](https://hexroll.app), and click
the `ROLL A SANDBOX` button:

Each generated sandbox has a unique URL that begins with `https://hexroll.app/sandbox/` following with a set of random charactes. When pressing the `ROLL A SANDBOX` button, HEXROLL first generates 
this URL and then presents you with the Realm Generator window.


!!! important
    When using HEXROLL as a guest, I have no way of associating the generated sandbox URL with you,
    so make sure you **bookmark your sandbox** page using your browser or copy and paste the URL
    to somewhere safe. Guest sandboxes are also ephemeral and public.
    
    **Patreon subscribers** should use the login button to generate a sandbox or claim any ephemeral
    sandbox they generated as guests.


You can optionally customize the generator settings and then click the `GENERATE` button:
