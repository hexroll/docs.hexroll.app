# The Hex map

The hex map is where you view, navigate and edit your sandbox topography.
This is where you will see your generated realms, and where you can edit terrain and main map features such as settlements and dungeons.

When you generate a realm, Hexroll will first create a set of regions, and within each region, a set of hexes. When Hexroll is done generating the content, it will proceed and generate a random map for you.

You can expand your map by generating more realms and build full continents or a set of islands.

## Navigating your map

To move around the hex map,  use your mouse to click and then drag in different directions.

You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.

If you zoom in close enough into any hex with a dungeon or a settlement, you will reveal a more detailed map inside the hex.

### Dungeon Maps

Dungeon maps are revealed when you zoom into any hex with a dungeon symbol. Dungeon maps feature a set of numbered and connected areas.

If you click any area in the dungeon map, you will enter crawl-mode.

### Settlement Maps

Settlement maps are revealed when you zoom into any hex with a settlement symbol. Settlement maps feature a schematic representation of structures for cities, towns and villages.

If you click any marked structure in the settlement map, you will enter crawl-mode.

!!! note
    Dungeon and settlement maps were not meant to be accurately scaled
    in geospatial units. They were designed to be easily navigated to and used as a
    visualization tool.


## Map Toggles


You can find the map toggles at the bottom-left side of the map window.
If you click the toggle icon, two additional icons will be revealed:

## The Map Lock

After generating a realm, your map will be `locked`. A locked maps is immutable. This is what you want it to be most of the time.
