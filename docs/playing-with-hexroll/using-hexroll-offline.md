# Using Hexroll Offline

No web application is 100% reliable. There is a very small chance that hexroll.app will be offline just at the moment your party is about to enter the dragon's lair.

Using Hexroll Backpack is a good contingency plan.

## What is Hexroll Backpack

Hexroll Backpack is an offline viewer for Hexroll sandbox data files. It is an Electron application encapsulating part of the online application.

Using Hexroll Backpack you can view a snapshot of your sandbox maps and content without being connected to our servers.

## Using Hexroll Backpack

First, click the download button to generate a snapshot data file of your sandbox.

Producing the snapshot data file may take while, depending on the scale of your sandbox.

The produced `.HBF` data file is a `sqlite3` file containing a rendered, read-only archive version of your sandbox.
Once your Hexroll Backpack file is ready, you will be presented with a download
link.

When you run Hexroll Backpack, it will ask for the location of your sandbox snapshot file. Point it to the file you downloaded earlier.
