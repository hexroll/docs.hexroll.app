VTT (Virtual TableTop) projection allows sharing and incrementally revealing hexroll maps with your players, as well as illustrating encounters and exploration with tokens.

## Hex map controls

### Revealing Hexes

To reveal or conceal hexes, hold down the `Spacebar` key and click any hex. Clicking a hex for the first time will partially reveal it, showing the players what kind of terrain is there.

Clicking the same hex another time will fully reveal the hex, including any settlement or dungeon symbol and any trail lines.

### Indicating Hexes

It is sometimes useful to highlight, or indicate hexes to your players when guiding or delivering lore.
To indicate hexes to your players, hold down the `F` key and click any hex you wish to indicate. Release the key to clear any indicated hex.

## Dungeon maps controls

### Revealing and concealing dungeon areas

!!! tip

    Use the Token Tags field to quickly filter tokens by category

Some tokens will have a torch or a lantern symbol overlay.

![VTT Token](/images/token.jpg)

This means that the token is also has a simulated light source.
A torch symbol indicates a short range light source and a lantern symbol indicates a long range light source.
You must have at least one light source token in the map for the players to see anything.

!!! note

    Even after adding a token with a light source, you will still need to reveal or conceal areas. This
    is, for example, how you can emulate closing and opening dungeon doors.

### Removing tokens

To remove tokens, hold down the `K` key and click the token you wish to remove.

### Changing tokens / using external tokens

You can edit any token by double-clicking it:

![Token Settings](/images/token-settings.jpg)

#### Color

#### Semi-transparent

Changes the opacity of the token (useful to indicate when characters are invisible for example)

#### label

Adds a label to the token

#### Light radius

Controls the light radius the token has (but map areas must still be revealed using `spacebar`)

#### Token PNG Link

Allow using PNG images as tokens via a URL. Note that the URL must be accessible by all players.

#### Scale factor

Allows scaling up the token size

#### Lock in place

Prevents moving or rotating the token. Useful for scenery tokens for example.

## Battlemaps

Any hex in the map can double as a battlemap. Simply zoom into the hex and place tokens on the grid.

    you can still join the sandbox session if there's at-least one browser connected.
