## Hex map controls

### Revealing Hexes
To reveal or conceal hexes, hold down the `Spacebar` key and click any hex. Clicking a hex for the first time will partially reveal it, showing the players what kind of terrain is there.

Clicking the same hex another time will fully reveal the hex, including any settlement or dungeon symbol and any trail lines.

### Indicating Hexes
It is sometimes useful to highlight, or indicate hexes to your players when guiding or delivering lore.
To indicate hexes to your players, hold down the `F` key and click any hex you wish to indicate. Release the key to clear any indicated hex.

## Dungeon maps controls

To reveal or conceal dungeon or cave areas, hold down the `Spacebar` key and click any area on the map. 

To add tokens to dungeon maps, hold down the `T` key and click the position you would like the token to be added to. Some tokens will have a torch or a lantern symbol overlay. 

![VTT Token](/images/token.jpg)

This means that the token is also has a simulated light source.
A torch symbol indicates a short range light source and a lantern symbol indicates a long range light source.
You must have at least one light source token in the map for the players to see anything.

!!! note
    Even after adding a token with a light source, you will still need to reveal or conceal areas. This
    is, for example, how you can emulate closing and opening dungeon doors.

To remove tokens, hold down the `K` key and click the token you wish to remove.

Players can disconnect by closing their browser tab. The VTT session will clear only if everyone is disconnected.

    you can still join the sandbox session if there's at-least one browser connected.
