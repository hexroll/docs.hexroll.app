# Solo and No-Spoilers modes

If when generating your sandbox you used the solo sandbox generator - then you will begin your hexcrawl
by choosing your preferred starting point using a window similar to this:

Clicking any one of the proposed locations will reveal the location hex and partially reveal its surrounding hexes:

!!! note

    Note that the no-spoilers mode is also toggled by-default.

Any mouse click on a partially revealed hex, or hex navigation using the WASD keys, will reveal the adjacent hex flower:

The enabled No-Spoilers mode will automatically mask most secrets and spoilers:
