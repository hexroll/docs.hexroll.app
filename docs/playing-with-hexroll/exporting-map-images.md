You can export `SVG` images of your visible map by pressing the camera button in the map view:

![Export as SVG](/images/export-image-button.jpg)

The map will then flicker (a side-effect of preparing the `SVG`) and the exported file will be downloaded to your device.

## Converting to other formats

`SVG` files are vector-format images. This means you can view or convert them to other formats in very-high resolutions.

Software packages such as GIMP or Photoshop can be used to do so, but you can also use your browser by employing its device emulation feature:

### Using your browser to convert SVG to PNG

Open the exported SVG file using your browser, press `F12` to go into _Developer Mode_ and then click the device emulation button:

![device-emulation](/images/device-emulation-mode.jpg)

Set your desired image resolution in the toolbar:

![image-resolution](/images/image-res.jpg)

Finally, use the menu button in the toolbar to capture a screenshot:

![image-resolution](/images/capture-screenshot.jpg)
