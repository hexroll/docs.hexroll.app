# Re-rolling Content

Following requests from the community, this version of Hexroll allows re-rolling
content. In fact, the entire generation engine was re-written for this purpose.

First, make sure you are in `crawl mode`.

Next, unlock the content by clicking the lock symbol in the header.

You will then be able to reroll the current entity by clicking the dice symbol in the header:

![Rerolling a Page](/images/reroll-page.jpg)

or reroll other linked entities by clicking any of the dice symbols inside the text:

![Reroll in a Page](/images/reroll-in-page.jpg)

!!! note

    Re-rolling entities might have a cascading effect on other parts of your sandbox. For example, if you re-roll a dungeon, any lost item or captive NPC will likely be relocated to other dungeons.
