# Editing Sandbox Content

Adding or revising sandbox pages can be also done by directly editing the page.
You can use editing to add lore, image links, or tales of your players bravery (or cowardice?)

## Editing Mode

To edit a page, click the quill symbol at the top-right corner of the window.

When you choose to edit a page, HEXROLL copies the generated version of the page and lets you edit the copied version.

To save your changes, click the save button in the editor toolbar, or lock the page.

## Embedding Images

Click the insert/edit image button to link images in your page:

## HP Checkmarks

When in editing mode, you can checkmark monsters and NPCs hitpoints. Select the HP boxes you'd like to checkmark:

Then click the `Toggle HP` button in the toolbar:


![HP toggle](/images/hp_toggle_button.jpg)

The checkbox will then get checked:

## Reverting Back

You can always revert to the generated version by clearing the entire text and saving.


Your edited text will become part of the sandbox file, and will be packaged when generating a sandbox snapshot for offline viewing.

!!! note
    Editing a page this way will not change any other part of the sandbox.
