# Editing Sandbox Content

Adding or revising sandbox pages can be also done by directly editing the page.
You can use editing to add lore, image links, or tales of your players bravery (or cowardice?)


To edit a page, first unlock the page for editing by clicking the lock icon in the top right corent of the screen, and then click the quill symbol.

When you choose to edit a page, HEXROLL copies the generated version of the page and lets you edit the copied version.

To save your changes, click the save button in the editor toolbar, or lock the page.

You can always revert to the generated version by clearing the entire text and saving.


Your edited text will become part of the sandbox file, and will be packaged when generating a sandbox snapshot for offline viewing.

!!! note
    Editing a page this way will not change any other part of the sandbox.
