# Ephemeral Sandboxes

## Using your sandbox online

Any sandbox you generate is first stored and managed online. When your sandbox is online, you can use all the editing
tools HEXROLL offers, as well as the built-in VTT mode.

To maintain reasonable performance, HEXROLL uses fast distributed storage to manage this data, but it can fill up pretty quickly and it is not free. To conserve storage, HEXROLL cleans any guest-generated sandbox after a predefined amount of time.


If you see the `Ephemeral Sandbox` note at the bottom-right corner of the screen, it means you have generated a sandbox
as a guest and that your sandbox will be removed from our online servers after one month since it was generated.

    Make sure you [download a snapshot](/playing-with-hexroll/using-hexroll-offline) of your ephemeral sandbox before it gets removed so you can have your own copy for offline viewing.

## Unlimited online storage

`Brave Adventurer` subscribers to Pen, Dice & Paper on __Patreon__ get to have unlimited online hosting of their generated sandboxes.

If you are a subscriber, you can claim any ephemeral sandbox you have generated by logging in to Patreon and navigating to your ephemeral sandbox URL. If the `Ephemeral Sandbox` note disappears from the screen, it means your sandbox has unlimited hosting duration.
